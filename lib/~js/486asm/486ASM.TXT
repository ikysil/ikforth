  The assembler files consist of 486ASM.F (the source code), ASMMAC.F 
  (optional macros), VCALL.F (Win32FORTH specific calls to FORTH words), 
  486ASM.DOC (this file), and COPYASM.486 (the license).  The rest of the

  Please distribute all of the assembler files together.  This file covers

  please make sure that all modifications are clearly labeled as such.


Why this is under the FSF's GPL:
  I am currently distributing this assembler under the terms of the Free
  Software Foundation's General Public License for two related reasons.  The
  first is that, while I respect and envy Tom Zimmer's skill at transmuting
  other's work into something that is convenient for him to use, this assembler
  is my baby, and I don't want him to mess with it too much.  Since the GPL
  specifically permits (and actually encourages) that covered software be
  experimented with, as long as all distributed copies carry conspicuous notice
  of where they were modified, this allows Tom to hack away to his heart's
  content, but gives me ultimate control over what hackery I will support.

  Second, because I want this assembler to be useful to the widest range of
  users, I want the users to have some gaurantee that they will be able to do
  just about whatever they want to with it, but I still want some control over
  the eventual outcome of the process.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
  This document assumes that the reader is familiar with both FORTH and 
  assembly language programming on the Intel(R) platform.

  Although the assembler is written for Andrew McKewan and Tom Zimmer's FORTH 
  for Windows 95 and NT, it should be portable to other operating 
  environments with minimal trouble.  The author would love to hear about 
  such ports.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
  * Support for all documented Intel(R) Pentium(tm) instructions

  * Includes the RDTSC instruction (which is documented by Intel(R) in the
      infamous ``Appendix H'', but described in several other
      places).

  * Includes support for the 386 & 486 Test registers.

  * User configurable code generation
      The user can select default 16 bit or default 32 bit code
      Automatically handles address and operand size overrides
      Supports both prefix and postfix syntaxes

  * User configurable error reporting/handling
      All but three errors are DEFERred
      User can turn all errors off or on
      User can turn on individual errors with slightly more effort

  * Local code labels with forward references
      Up to 19 local labels (or more with judicious hacking) in a
        a primative or subroutine
      Up to 10 local labels in macros
      Up to 256 simultaneously unresolved forward references to
        local labels (or more with judicious hacking)
      Syntax is based on the TASM ``@@'' syntax for local labels

  * Supports creation of new primatives, macros and subroutines

  * Allows calling FORTH words from assembly code (Win32FORTH only)

  * Support for out of scope forward references


Misfeatures:
  * Some bonehead errors can't be caught
      For example, using a local label as a data item will create
      some spectacularly interesting, but incorrect, code

  * Some addressing modes for some instructions are not supported
      IMUL will only take one operand

  * Not all instructions are assembled as compactly as possible


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard compliance:
  This program is substantially compliant with the ANS for the FORTH
  programming language, with these exceptions:

  This program is expected to be compiled on a system where upper and lower
  cases are equivalent.  A conversion to uppercase may be required to make
  this program portable to your FORTH system.

  The words DEFER, DEFER@ and IS, as used in this program, are substantially
  the same as the standard code stream:

    : NOOP ;
    : DEFER CREATE ['] NOOP , DOES> @ EXECUTE ;
    : DEFER@
        ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE @ ELSE @ THEN ; IMMEDIATE
    : IS
        ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE ! ELSE ! THEN ; IMMEDIATE

  The word +TO, as used in this program, is intended to add the number on the
  stack to the stored value of the VALUE following it in the code stream.  If
  VALUE is defined as:

    : VALUE CREATE , DOES> @ ;

  and TO is defined as:

    : TO
        ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE  ! ELSE  ! THEN ; IMMEDIATE

  then a working definition of +TO would be:

    : +TO
        ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE +! ELSE +! THEN ; IMMEDIATE

  Unfortunately, this word has no standard implementation.

  The words ASSEMBLER, ASM-HIDDEN, IN-FORTH, IN-ASM, and IN-HIDDEN, as used and
  defined in this program, are substantially the same as the standard code 
  stream:

    FORTH-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT
    WORDLIST CONSTANT ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST
    : ASSEMBLER GET-ORDER ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST ROT DROP SWAP SET-ORDER ;

    ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT
    WORDLIST CONSTANT HIDDEN-WORDLIST
    : ASM-HIDDEN GET-ORDER HIDDEN-WORDLIST ROT DROP SWAP SET-ORDER ;

    HIDDEN-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT
    : SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER ONLY GET-ORDER FORTH-WORDLIST SWAP HIDDEN-WORDLIST
                          ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST ROT 3 + SET-ORDER ;
    : IN-FORTH SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER FORTH-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT ;
    : IN-ASM SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT ;
    : IN-HIDDEN SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER HIDDEN-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT ;

  The words prefixed with ``CODE-'' act directly on the target dictionary, and
  have no standard implementation.  If your FORTH system does not provide words
  to directly alter the contents of the dictionary, this assembler is not
  portable to your system.

  The words that are implied by the deferred words CODE, ;CODE, SUBR:, and
  END-CODE make several assumptions about the FORTH system in general, and the
  dictionary in particular.  The header creation words, compiler security, and
  more esoteric vocabulary manipulations have either non-trivial or no standard
  implementation.  If your system does not provide comparable words, this
  assembler is not directly portable to your system.

  The assembler source fragment ``CURRENT DATA-@'' is equivalent to the
  standard code stream ``GET-CURRENT'', while the assembler source code fragment
  ``CURRENT DATA-!'' is equivalent to the standard code stream ``SET-CURRENT''

  The assembler assumes that items on the stack are at least 32 bits wide.

  The assembler requires the words ALSO, FORTH, ONLY, and PREVIOUS from the
  search order extension wordset.

  The redefinition of EXIT in the ASSEMBLER vocabulary is non-standard.  First,
  it tracks macro nesting so that EXIT can be used in macros.  Second, using it
  from the console is effectively a no-op.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:
  The source file (486ASM.F) must be somewhere that your FORTH system can find
  it.  For Win32FORTH, this is the same directory in which the FORTH system
  files reside.  To load the assembler in Win32FORTH, type (at the FORTH
  command line) ``fload 486asm.f''  Other FORTHs may be different.  Check
  the documentation that came with your system.  That's all there is to it.

  To load the optional macro package ``ASMMAC.F'', the FORTH word calling
  routines in ``VCALL.F'', or the Win32 FORTH specific macros in ``ASMWIN32.F'',
  you must follow a similar process.

  If you received this assembler as part of Tom Zimmer's and Andrew McKewan's
  FORTH for Windows 95 and NT, it's already installed.  To install an updated
  version, you need to run the FORTH kernel and load the file ``EXTEND.F''.
  Currently, running the Windows command line (either from the Run... menu
  item or an icon) ``FKERNEL FLOAD EXTEND.F BYE'' does the trick.

  Notes for users of FORTH systems other than Win32FORTH:
  If your system does not already contain an ASSEMBLER vocabulary, remove the
  parens around the phrase ``( vocabulary assembler )'' in the source code.
  The virtual call instructions assembled in ``VCALL.F'' probably won't work
  on your system without modification.



==================================== USING ===================================
Creating primatives:
  The word CODE creates the header for an executable low-level word, puts the
  ASSEMBLER vocabulary in the search order, and does miscellaneous prep for
  assembly.  By default, the assembly syntax is operator-operands (eg. MOV
  AX , BX).  This can be changed by executing POSTFIX in the ASSEMBLER
  vocabulary, and changed back with PREFIX.  Because of the timing
  considerations involved (prefix mode works by doing the assembly an
  instruction late), these words should be executed only before code is actually
  generated, or right after the word ``A;''.  By default, the assembler
  generates 32 bit code.  This can be changed by executing USE16 or USE32.
  These should also only be used before code is generated, or right after the
  word ``A;''.  Operands must be separated with a freestanding comma (",").
  Numeric constants are assumed to be addresses unless they are preceded by a
  "#".  Assembly is ended with the word END-CODE or ;C.

  If you load the optional macro package ``ASMMAC.F'', commas can be combined
  with their preceding operands, provided that operand is not a numeric value.

  For example, if you load ``ASMMAC.F'', the code fragment:

          MOV EAX, # ' FOO
          MOV ECX, [EAX] [EDI]

  is equivalent to:

          MOV EAX , # ' FOO
          MOV ECX , [EAX] [EDI]


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating subroutines:
  The word SUBR: creates the header for a subroutine in the ASSEMBLER 
  vocabulary, puts the ASSEMBLER vocabulary in the search order, and does 
  miscellaneous prep for assembly.  The subroutine's header can only be found 
  during subsequent assembly.  Subsequent execution of the subroutine's name 
  leaves the address of the subroutine on the stack.  Other than that, the 
  subroutine is treated exactly like a CODE definition, as far as the assembler 
  is concerned.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating macros:
  The word MACRO: essentially does the same thing as the word :, with some
  chicanery with the search order.  It also initializes the macro-scoped local
  labels (discussed below). MACROs are created in the ASSEMBLER vocabulary.
  Macros are ended with either ENDM or ;MACRO (or ;M, if you load the optional
  macro package ASMMAC.F).  Since macros are essentially colon definitions, no
  (machine) code is actually generated by defining them, but rather by invoking
  them.

  Because of the way parameters on the stack are handled by the assembler, any 
  parameters to the macro should be saved onto the return stack before the 
  first assembly instruction, and popped from it as needed.  Register 
  parameters *MUST* be removed from the operand stack and saved until they are 
  needed.  When they are to be used, they *MUST* be pushed back onto the 
  operand stack.  The words to do this are POP-OP and PUSH-OP.  Finally, any 
  non-assembly code *MUST* leave the stack balanced.

  Unless the macro parses for its own parameters, the parameters have to be
  available before the macro is invoked.  Note: passing in a local label to
  a macro won't work!  The local label handler will assume that the label
  is used by the first instruction assembled after the label is invoked.
  However, parsing a local label out of the input stream and executing it in
  the macro will work.

  The word /SET-POSTFIX safely sets the assembler syntax to postfix, and returns
  a flag to tell the which mode the assembler was in previously.  The word
  RESET-SYNTAX restores the assembler syntax to the way it was before.
  Bracketing your macro code with ``/SET-POSTFIX >R'' and ``R> RESET-SYNTAX''
  will insure that the macro is executed in postfix mode.  The word /SET-PREFIX
  works similarly, and returns a flag that is compatible with /SET-POSTFIX.
  Because no machine code is generated until your macro is executed, I strongly
  suggest that your macros assume that the syntax is unknown until they
  explicitly set it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using local labels:
  Local labels can be used anywhere a branch destination address can appear. 
  Local labels have two forms:  definition scoped labels and macro scoped 
  labels.  Definition scoped label references have the form ``@@n'', where n is 
  a digit from 1 to 9.  Macro scoped label references have the form ``@@Mn'', 
  where n is a digit from 0 to 9, or alternately, ``L$n''.  Labels are bound to 
  a particular address by word of the form ``@@n:'' for definition scoped 
  labels and ``@@Mn:'' or ``L$n:'' for macro scoped labels.  As the designation 
  implies, definition scoped labels are "visible" throughout the entire 
  definition in which they occur, including in any macros used in the 
  definition.  It's not an error to bind a label more than once.  It is 
  (usually) benign for a macro to reference a definition scoped label, but 
  (usually) a bad idea for a macro to bind a definition scoped label.  For 
  example, in the code fragment:

    MACRO: DELAY ( x -- ) /SET-PREFIX >R >R
            MOV ECX , # R>
            @@1: LOOP @@1
            >R RESTORE-SYNTAX
    ENDM
    CODE FOO ( -- )
            ...
            30 DELAY
            JMP @@1
            ...

  the label @@1 is bound in the macro DELAY, which will cause FOO to go into
  an infinite loop.  For this reason, the assembler also provides macro
  scoped labels.  They can safely be used anywhere, including at definition
  scope.    Since their scope disappears with the macro that invoked them,
  they can be the source of some subtle errors, however.  For example, if
  one macro references a label but doesn't bind it, and another macro at the
  same lexical level references and binds the label,  that binding will also be
  effective for the earlier macro.  If the macros are reversed, the reference in
  the later macro will never be resolved.

  The macro scoped labels come in two forms because Tom Zimmer is fond of the
  alternate syntax.  The words ``@@Mn'' and ``L$n'', where n is the same digit
  for both, are identical, and similar remarks apply to ``@@Mn:'' and ``L$n:''.
  They are macro scoped because macro scoped labels are more flexible.

  Also, binding a label in the middle of an instruction is a bad idea.  Because
  the label binder forces the previous instruction to finish assembling, this
  code fragment:

          ADD EBX, [EAX] @@1: [EDI]
          ADD CL, 4 [EBP]

  will actually appear to the assembler as:

          ADD EBX, [EAX]
          @@1: ADD [EDI] CL, 4 [EBP]

  This kind of error (while obvious in this example) may (or may not)
  generate a "bad addressing mode" error.  Although it is possible to bind
  a local label to the address of, say, a mod-r/m byte, it requires somewhat
  subtle hackery, and it's generally a fairly bad idea.

  Also, the local labels are *code* labels.  Currently, there is no way to
  create a local label to a data item (and I have no immediate plans to
  implement one...).

  If you need more than 10 macro scoped local labels, increase the value 
  MACRO-LABELS to the number of labels that you need, and use the words 
  CREATE-MACRO-REF and CREATE-MACRO-BIND (in the ASM-HIDDEN vocabulary) to 
  create the local label reference and binding words.  Each takes a number from 
  the stack.  The numbers 0 through 9 are already in use, so the new reference 
  and binding words must use parameters in the range 10 to the new value in 
  MACRO-LABELS, minus one.  By doing this, you also increase the space 
  available for definition scoped local labels.  The reference and binding 
  words for definition scoped local labels are created with CREATE-REF and 
  CREATE-BIND respectively (again, in the ASM-HIDDEN vocabulary).  The words 
  that control label scoping, referencing and binding are in the ASM-HIDDEN 
  vocabulary.  If you have deeply nested macros, you may also need to increase 
  the constant LBMAX in the source code and recompile.  If need more than 256 
  unresolved references to local labels, increase the constant FRMAX in the 
  source code and recompile. "Out of the box", the assembler supports macros 
  nested up to 28 levels deep.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controlling error reporting:
  The error handling words are all DEFER-red.  This is done, rather than having
  them check a status variable, to permit finer control over which errors are
  reported.  The word NO-ERRORS turns off error reporting, while the word
  REPORT-ERRORS turns on error reporting.  Error checking words can be turned
  on or off individually, with judicious hacking.  Either of the built in words
  to control error handling and reporting will put the error checking words
  in a known state.  If you need to individually turn off or on error words,
  I strongly encourage you to read the source code for both the error word
  itself and NO-ERRORS and REPORT-ERRORS so you know how many parameters your
  error handler is expected to deal with.  Also, you can't turn off errors
  associated with table or stack overflows (currently dealing with forward
  referenced local labels and the operand stack) without either changing the
  source code or catching the interpreter that is running the assembler.  As
  a final caveat, some of the ``error handling'' words also set flags in the
  assembler.  One point: in postfix mode (the default) reports are delayed until
  after the next instruction in the code stream is encountered.  This is due
  to the way that FORTH processes words.  This is not a bug in the assembler.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use as a cross-assembler:
  All of the words that generate actual code or headers to be found in the
  target are DEFER-red.  The assembler can be retooled as a cross-assembler with
  minimal difficulty.  Simply redirect all of the words that start with
  ``CODE-'' to use words that operate on the intended target address space.
  You will also have to define words analogous to CODE, ;CODE, END-CODE, and
  ;C to create headers in the target.

  Of course, the cross-assembler will still only generate code for an x86.

  I have also added the word REGISTER-REF to the ASM-HIDDEN vocabulary to
  facilitate out of scope forward references.  This word takes a number and a
  type from the parameter stack and returns the number.  It is called by the
  words that compile displacements and immediate data.  The type values are
  also defined in ASM-HIDDEN.  In the out-of-the-box assembler, REGISTER-REF
  just discards the type value.  I have also added a word to make it easy to
  install a "registration agent".  The word SET-REGISTER-REF in the FORTH
  wordlist takes an execution token from the top of the stack and installs it
  as REGISTER-REF.
  
  There is also a word to process notifications on instruction boundaries.  The 
  word REGISTER-ASM is called just before an instruction is assembled.  It will 
  enable you to conveniently determine what is being compiled.  This can be 
  used, for example, to process special cases in an optomizing subroutine 
  threaded FORTH system.  For example, if your STC FORTH system uses the 
  assembler for colon definitions, and you keep track of the last CALL 
  instruction that was assembled, when you see a semicolon to terminate the 
  definition, you can change the last CALL to a JMP, and suppress the assembly 
  of a RET instruction. The word REGISTER-ASM is executed with the operand and 
  parameter stacks set up for the assembly of the next instruction, with the 
  top of the parameter stack containing the execution token of the word that 
  will do the actual assembly on top of the argument to that word.  It has to 
  leave the stacks in such a state that the assembly can continue.  If you 
  remove the execution token on the stack, it has to be replaced with a new 
  one, or you will raise an exeception, since the execution token is used 
  immediately after REGISTER-ASM returns.  The word SET-REGISTER-ASM in the 
  FORTH wordlist can be used to revector REGISTER-ASM.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calling FORTH words from assembly language:
  If you are using Win32FORTH, you can use the words defined in the file
  ``VCALL.F'' to call FORTH words from assembly language.  The macro FCALL
  is defined to allow you to do this conveniently.  It parses the input
  stream for a word name, and causes this code to be assembled:

          MOV EAX, # (xt of word name)
          CALL VCALL

  If you are trying to call unnamed words, you must move the execution token
  of the word into the eax register yourself, and assemble a call to VCALL.
  VCALL expects that the eax register contains a valid execution token, and
  the top of the machine stack contains a valid return address.

  Note: because FCALL parses the input stream, you must provide a word name.
  Also, this performs absolutely no error checking.  Calling VCALL with a
  random value in EAX will almost certainly raise an exception.



================================== APPENDIX ==================================
On the misfeatures:
  Some bonehead errors won't be caught.  Of course, if you wanted all of your
  boneheaded errors caught, you'd be programming in a boneheaded language...
  The solution supported by the assembler is simple: Don't DO that!

  For example, using a local label as a data address won't be caught, and will
  mung your code.  The reason:  I didn't feel like coding RESOLVE to look for
  every single possible branch.  It looks for 0e8h, 0e9h, or 0fh to decide if
  the offset is NEAR or SHORT.  Since the 486 uses relative branches, the
  address put into the operand slot will be incorrect.  And since almost all of
  the instructions that take memory operands also require a mod-r/m byte,
  BACKPATCH will be off by one, anyway...

  Further, not all addressing modes are supported for all instructions.  In
  particular, IMUL only supports the implied AL/AX/EAX, register/memory
  addressing mode.  Also, instructions with implied operands don't handle
  them consistently when they are present in the code.  For example, LODS
  will check for [SI] or [ESI], to determine the address size, but it won't
  check for AL, etc., and MUL only checks for AL, etc. if it can't determine
  the size of the second operand.  This will (hopefully) be fixed in a later
  version.

  A related problem is that the assembler doesn't fully screen all addressing
  modes.  For example, the assembler will accept as perfectly reasonable the
  fragment ``JMP CS: [ECX] @@1'', which will be clobbered by the local label
  binder when @@1 is bound.  Since it has a segment override (and maybe an
  address size prefix, which is accounted for in the local label binder), which
  is not one of the three cases the local label binder looks for as a NEAR
  offset, it will patch the opcode byte for JMP with the displacement from the
  mod-r/m byte to the bound address of @@1.  The case when @@1 is already bound
  is not quite as spectacular, as @@1 will be used as a displacement from ECX,
  which will result in effectively ``JMP CS:[ECX+@@1]''.  When the segment
  override is absent, the binder will patch the mod-r/m byte with the offset
  from the displacement field to the address of @@1.  This is one of the class
  of the most spectacular errors that can be generated.  Some coding errors
  actually generate valid object code.  For example, the fragment ``FIST
  QWORD [EAX]'' will actually assemble as ``FBSTP TBYTE [EAX]''.  Since FIST
  does not support a QWORD memory operand, the error is in the code, not the
  assembler.

  Also, the assembler doesn't generate the world's tightest code.  That's
  because the assembler is complicated enough without having it check for
  every special case.  If there's both a register, reg/mem and an (e)ax,
  reg/mem form of the instruction, the register, reg/mem form will also
  work if the register is (e)ax.  However, the assembler is smart enough not
  to assemble an unnecessary zero offset.  Even so, just the support routines
  are larger than an 8086 assembler I wrote, which was more than twice as large
  as the first assembler I wrote.  (Of course, most of that overhead is for
  things like local labels, flexible code generation, and flexible error
  handling...  Still, the assembler _is_ larger than any other source file in
  the Win32FORTH distribution, except for the fkernel.f file...)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsupported instructions:
  Currently, all Intel(R) documented assembly mnemonics are supported, but not
  all addressing modes are supported.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:
  One of the truely wonderful things about FORTH is the ease with which 
  bugs can be isolated and killed.  During this project, the average time 
  to design and enter 10k of source code was about 6 hours, while the 
  average time to debug 10k of source code was about 1 hour.  For a C 
  program of comparable complexity, the times would be about 8 hours and 8 
  hours, respectively.  (Of course, the average time to *document* 10k of 
  source code was ...) Thus, FORTH code can be somewhat more bug free than 
  comparable C code.  Still, I'm virtually certain that somewhere in all my 
  beautiful code someone will find a really obvious, obnoxious bug.

  If you find a bug, I really want to hear about it, provided it is:
    
    1. Reproducible -- If I can't find it on my system, I can't fix it. At 
       a minimum, I need to know which version of the assembler you are 
       using, which FORTH it is running on, exactly what conditions cause 
       it to manifest, and what you think the error is.

    2. Actually in my code -- If you (or someone else) modified the 
       assembler, you're on your own.  I'm sorry, but I really don't have 
       time to wade through several pages of assembler source code to find 
       that you mistook al for ax. As another caution:  Tom's interpreter 
       may do strange things with words that aren't found in the search 
       order.  For example, the word ``L$11:'', which is not defined in my 
       assembler, but looks a lot like one of my local labels, will be 
       interpreted as a method selector, and give you a truly strange error 
       message.

    3. Actually a bug -- If the assembler incorrectly turns semantically 
       well formed statements into machine code, that is a bug.  However, 
       although I tried to catch the most obvious errors, the assembler is 
       free to create bogus machine code from semantically incorrect 
       statements.  This is not a bug of the assembler, but a problem with 
       whoever tried to assemble the garbage in the first place.  Related 
       to this: turning off error reporting will leave the stack balanced 
       if you encounter an error, but it will almost certainly produce 
       bogus code.


  To report a bug that fits the above conditions, send me e-mail to
 consulting@altnet.net.  Please make bug reports as detailed as possible, and
  send it with a subject line of ``bug report 486asm.f''.  If you don't
  have e-mail access, you can send a letter to me in care of Frank Hall,
  POBox 14162 Oakland, CA 94614.  Since this method is slower (and more
  likely to cost me money), the e-mail method is preferred.  I will reply
  to either in the same manner.


Enhancements, Bug fixes:
  If you have an enhancement or bug fix, I definitely want to hear from you.
  Send a diff with an indication of which version it applies to the e-mail
  address above.  If you can't create a diff, compress and uuencode the
  entire (modified) assembler and e-mail it to me.  If you don't have e-mail,
  you can mail me either a diff (hard copy or disc) or the entire assembler
  (disc only, please) at the US mail address given above.  If I incorporate
  the change in a future version, you'll be the first to get a copy, and I'll
  acknowledge your contribution in the new version.  If you send me an entire
  assembler, please clearly indicate what was changed and why.  If you send
  me a hard copy of an entire assembler, however, it will probably be a loooong
  time before I get a chance to look at it.  I can only read 3.5" PC floppies.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version history:
  1.0a -- Initial very small scale beta release.  Very little floating point
          support.
  1.0b -- (Not released)  More complete floating point support.
  1.0c -- Fixed a bug having to do with reg,mem addressing modes when the 
          displacement is 0, and another related bug having to do with mem,reg 
          addressing when the destination address is 0.  Added macro scoped 
          labels.  Created a macro file for ``REG,'' operands.  Finished 
          floating point instruction set.
  1.0d -- Fixed a bug dealing with ebp, immediate addressing modes.  Reorganized
          the assembler somewhat to make it more convenient to use.  Changed the
          names of the assembler source and documentation files.
  1.0e -- Merged Tom Zimmer's local label hackery into the assembler.  Fudged
          with vocabulary declarations.  Updated the documentation.  Actually
          defined the words FIST and FISTP, which had compiling engines in
          the dictionary already...Created the file ``vcall.f'' to call into
          FORTH words.
  1.0f -- Corrected FBLD, which was incorrect in the 1990 Intel(R) doc.  Also
          corrected FSTSW/FNSTSW for the same reason.
  1.1  -- Updated the assembler to assemble the new Pentium(tm) instructions.
          Changed /SET-POSTFIX and RESET-SYNTAX to simple colon definitions.
          Moved Win32 FORTH specific code to asmwin32.f.  Changed distribution
          restrictions on asmwin32.f to unrestricted, public domain.
  1.2  -- Fixed FSTSW AX, FRSTOR, FIST, and FISTP.  Fixed typo in the name of
          FISUBR.  Deferred CODE, ;CODE, and END-CODE to support
          cross-compiling.  Changed ;C to be a deferred synonym for END-CODE,
          for added flexibility.  Finally got around to adding a
          ``Contributors'' section.  Added the Free Software Foundation's
          broilerplate notice to all covered source files.
  1.21 -- Added REGISTER-REF to support out of scope forward references for use
          in cross assembly/meta compiling.  Added justification for using the
          FSF's GPL.  Fixed PUSHA/PUSHAD.  Added a definition for EXIT-ASSEMBLER
          to deal with Tom's dictionary search lookaside cache.
  1.22 -- Fixed an off by one bug in DO-DISP.  Made group 2 (shift/rotate)
          instructions generate size prefixes.  Fixed push/pop segment register.
          Fixed ?reg,mem to accept a direct offset as a memory operand.
  1.23 -- Fixed a bug dealing with IMMEDIATE operands.  Fixed an error in the
          documentation dealing with the vocabulary manipulations.  Made exit
          closer to the standard -- but now it won't work from the console!
          Removed 486asm.gls from the distribution, as it is *WAY* out of date.
  1.24 -- Fixed a bug in I/O instructions having to do with size prefixes.  It
          seems the assembler was setting a flag without bothering to check it..
          Changed GROUP1-COMPILE to assemble 8 bit immediate operands when
          possible.  I think I also removed ASMWIN32.F from the distribution at
          this point, but I forgot to document exactly when...(added during the
          1.25 update).
  1.241 - Tom Zimmer found a bug in the way sib bytes are handled in 16 bit
          bit code.  This has been fixed.
  1.25 -- Added a registration function for code creation.  A debugger,
          optomizer, or other interested party can arrange for notification at
          each instruction boundary.  Also cleaned up the documentation.
  1.26 -- Changed the definition of [esp*2] (which isn't valid) to [ebp*2].
          Changed [esp*2], to [ebp*2],.  Changed [ebp*n] (n is one of 4,8) to
          the correct Scale/Index values (previously off by one).

Glossary:
  The glossary has been removed from the distribution as being hopelessly out
  of date.

Contributors: 
  (These people have helped this project enormously in one way or another.)
  Andrew McKewan       - wrote the kernel and wrapper for the FORTH system I 
                         now use almost exclusively.
  Tom Zimmer           - souped up that kernel to tremendous heights.  He 
                         also nagged me enough to get me to write the 
                         assembler in the first place.  If that isn't enough, 
                         he is also the major distributor of the assembler.
  Bob Smith            - pointed out some subtle bugs in the floating point 
                         words.
  Steven M. Brault     - found all of the bugs that were fixed in 1.22.
  Anton Ertl           - pointed out that my previous version of 
                         SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER didn't work.
  Andrey Cherezov      - found a bug concerning PUSH # <data>.
  Vladimir F. Ibatulin - found a bug concerning operand sizes for I/O
                         instructions.
  Bruce Hoyt           - pointed out the illegal addressing mode [esp*2].  
                         This led to the discovery of bad constants in the 
                         [ebp*n] modes.
